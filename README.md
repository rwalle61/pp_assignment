Node app with html webpages allowing user to search for music events in the UK.

Access on IBM Cloud at https://rwalle61.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/events2017/index.html
(If the app is asleep, wake it at https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps)

The main file is server.js. To run locally, git clone then run "npm install", then "npm start" to run on localhost port 8090. When running, access the html page at http://localhost:8090/events2017/index.html

The html, css, and javaScript combine together to show and animate the webpages.

Authentication is done server-side, within the 'routes.js' file.
